# Zero-shot_LSCM_His1_Mut
*For* ***Enhanced Polypropylene Degradation via Large-Scale Computational Model Evolved HIS1 Dioxygenase***

Zero-shot_ESM2_parallel.py is the mainly script to get the fitness Landscape
**Fitness score** is the most weight attribution to the **Scorer**
The whole procession used FoldX, ESM2 and a lot of models to build the **LSCM_Scorer**, which made the His1 comes to more efficiency.
